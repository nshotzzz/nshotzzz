## âœ¨ | About Me
Hi, I'm *****, aka NShotzz, and I'm starting out as a programmer. I've studied some programming languages before, but I ended up leaving it aside. Now, I'm getting back into it and learning Git and GitHub to help improve my skills.

I'm excited to keep learning and become a skilled programmer. I want to contribute to the programmer community and make a difference. Thank you for allowing me to share a little bit about myself.
